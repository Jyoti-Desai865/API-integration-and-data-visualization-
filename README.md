The objective of this project was to demonstrate how to integrate a public API and visualize the retrieved data using Python. The task was performed by connecting to the OpenWeatherMap API, fetching real-time weather forecast data for a given city, and presenting it visually through a Streamlit dashboard. The dashboard displays trends in temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions over a five-day period.
The project begins with setting up a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, a Python library designed for building interactive web applications. The user is prompted to enter a city name, which is used to request forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The API returns weather information in JSON format, including timestamps, temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions.
Once the data is fetched using the requests library, it is organized and processed using pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. This step involves selecting relevant fields such as datetime, temperature, humidity, and weather type, and converting them into a structured DataFrame for analysis.For visualization, the project uses Seaborn, a high-level data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. 
This project was implemented using the Python programming language in a development environment like Visual Studio Code. The final application runs as a web app using Streamlit, which can be launched locally or deployed online for public access.
This type of task is especially relevant in real-world applications such as weather monitoring tools, travel apps, or dashboards used by environmental agencies. It is also suitable for academic assignments, data science projects, or portfolio demonstrations where the goal is to showcase API usage, data processing, and visualization skills.
